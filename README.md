# Supabase MCP Server

> Connect your Supabase project to AI assistants in Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, and others.

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) standardizes how Large Language Models (LLMs) talk to external services like Supabase. It allows your AI assistants to interact directly with your Supabase project and perform tasks like managing tables, fetching config, and querying data.
